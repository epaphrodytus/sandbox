| [Module](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Module)                                    | "The basic unit of code reuseability in Python"; when written in pure python refers to a single.py file                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)        | "A versioned archive file that may contain Python packages, modules, and other resource files that are used to distribute a Release"; This is what is downloaded by end-users and will be installed                                                                                   |
| [Import Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Import-Package)                    | "A Python module which can contain other modules or recursively, other packages                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Source Distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist) | "A distribution _format_ that provides metadata and the essential source files needed for installing by a tool like pip (i.e., online), or for generating a Built Distribution"                                                                                                       |
| [Built Distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Built-Distribution)            | "A distribution _format_ containing files and metadata that only need to be moved to the correct location on the target system to be installed." The tense is maybe the clue here. It is already "built" so it does not need a build. Example of this is wheel.                       |
| [Build Frontend](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Build-Frontend)                    | You can think of this as the storefront by which you obtain Distribution Packages. Example of this are pip and build. The actual installation work is done by the Build Backend                                                                                                       |
| [Build Backend](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Build-Backend)                      | "A library that takes a source tree or source distribution and builds a source distribution or wheel from it." I am going to assume that the second "source distribution" there actually refers to a "built distribution". Examples of Build Backends are setuptools, hatchling etc., |

### Learning Points:

- When you see the word "package" you need to distinguish between "Distribution Packages" and "Import Packages". Distribution Packages refer to a pice of downloadable software. Import packages typically refer to a directory on a file system that could contain .py files which are modules, and possible other directories which are subpackages.
  - Using flask as an example: when we install flask we write `pip install Flask` but when we work with Flask in python we use `import flask`. In the former, `Flask` refers to the distribution package named 'Flask', in the latter, `flask` refers to the import package i.e., a directory that is named 'flask'.
  - Another familiar example might be the `scikit-learn` package (Distribution!). When installing it, we do `pip install scikit-learn` but when using it, we do `import sklearn`. In this case, there is a clear difference between the reference to the Distribution Package `scikit-learn` and the Import Package `sklearn`.
- When referring to "Import Packages" there is a further need to distinguish between ["Namespace Packages"](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) and "Regular Packages". The former lacks an \_\_init\_\_.py file. The \_\_init\_\_.py files mark directories that function as packages.
- Different build backends have different pre-requisities that need to be prepared before they can be used. Sometimes everything can be defined within the `pyproject.toml` file and sometimes additional configuration files like `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`.
- Note that when using build to build the distributions, by default, 2 files are generated. One that ends with a `.tar.gz` extension, and one that ends with a `.whl` extension. The former is a source distribution package, and the latter is a built distribution package. As the [python documentation suggests](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/overview/#python-binary-distributions), both should be published side by side.
